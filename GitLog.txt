--all - Pretend as if all the refs in refs/, along with HEAD, are listed on the command line as <commit>.

--oneline - This is a shorthand for "--pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit" used together.

--graph - Draw a text-based graphical representation of the commit history on the left hand side of the output. This may cause extra lines to be printed in between commits, in order for the graph history to be drawn properly. Cannot be combined with --no-walk.

This enables parent rewriting, see History Simplification above.

This implies the --topo-order option by default, but the --date-order option may also be specified.
